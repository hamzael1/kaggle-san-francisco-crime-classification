# Dataset

`This dataset contains incidents derived from SFPD Crime Incident Reporting system. The data ranges from 1/1/2003 to 5/13/2015. The training set and test set rotate every week, meaning week 1,3,5,7... belong to test set, week 2,4,6,8 belong to training set. `

# Evaluation

`Submissions are evaluated using the multi-class logarithmic loss. Each incident has been labeled with one true class. For each incident, you must submit a set of predicted probabilities (one for every class). `
